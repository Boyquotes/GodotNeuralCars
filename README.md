# GodotNeuralCars
A simple test of a Neural Network made in the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/license/) v3.5.2.
This definitely wasn't made to be a good project, but I thought I'll share it cause why not.
## Downloading
Consider playing the [Browser Version](https://gopherdev.itch.io/2d-car-evolution) on itch.io, downloads are also available here on github and on the itch page.
## Building
To build the project, download Godot Engine v3.5.2 from the [Official Site](https://godotengine.org/) (or [build it yourself](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)).
